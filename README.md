# hello-world
A time honoured tradition I too want to follow

Hi,
my name is Arved and I am here to learn. I am fairly green when it comes to messing with data and coding, but hope to be able to shed those leaves soon.
My main task here is to find out how these things work in order to then identify any and all opportunities they might offer me, my career, and the organisations I work for.
